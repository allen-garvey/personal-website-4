I love the web because its open nature means there are no gatekeepers or proprietary tools in the way of creating, publishing or viewing websites. My favorite part of software development is being able to identify a problem, brainstorm and prototype a solution, and then refine that into a finished product. Some of my other hobbies include: drawing and digital painting, playing and writing music, hiking, photography, and chess.',
