        body: `I specialize in front-end web development as one of my passions is how people can use computers to fuel their creativity and increase their productivity, and I believe the web is the most democratic and accessible way to do that. However my curiosity has taken me far afield and I've worked at times in full-stack web development, desktop and mobile app, and command-line tools. Some of my other hobbies include playing and writing music, photography, chess, long walks, photography and creating digital and traditional art.`
